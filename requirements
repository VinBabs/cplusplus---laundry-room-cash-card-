You need to define 4 classes as VTM, money cards, washer and dryer individually. 

The majority of class interface methods reside in VTM. Assume that each VTM can 

dynamically create up to 10 money cards after it is replenished, and will display 

proper message when it is out of cards. It only accepts $1, $5, $10 and $20 bills, and 

it adds 10% for each $10 bill, and 15% for each $20. Washer costs $1.25 for each 

load, and dryer costs $0.35 per 10 minutes.

You are required to write an interactive program to simulate the operation with two 

cards, one is bought for $10 and the other is bought for $20. $10 card is used to pay 2 

loads of washing, and 30 minutes drying twice, and refill it with $10. $20 card is

used to pay 4 loads of washing, and 30 minutes drying four times, and refill it with 

$10. Print balance of VTM, two cards, washers and dryers.
